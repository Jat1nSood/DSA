Brute Force:

Intution here is that we know that an INORDER of a BST is always in accending order. We use that property here.
We do a inorder od the tree and store keys in an array. After that we check for each elemnet if it is greater than
the comming elemnet is the array. If that is the case then that pair is violating BST propertu and we increase count

TC here is O(n^2)
SC is o(H) H is height of the recursive tree
