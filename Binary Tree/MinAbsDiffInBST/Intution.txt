Brute Force:

Intution here is to use the property of BST that Its inorder is always
sorted in accending order. So we create a array and put elemnts in arr using inorder traversal
Once array is ready we traverse it and take mindiffernce betwee every consecutive pair of elements
At the end we min diff

TC here is O(n)  + O(n)
SC is O(n)

OOptimized 

We simply create variable name prev = -1. We simply know that every upcoming elenet in inorder traversal is going to be greater than last
so we take difference of prev and current eleemnt  and if it is lesser than preveous difference we update ans. and the ve update prev with curr node.

TC here is : O(n)
SC O(1)
