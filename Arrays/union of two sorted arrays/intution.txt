Brute Force:

Intution Here is to use a hashmap to store those elements which are already inside the array.

Flow --> Step1 -->> Put arr1 in ans and its elemnts in hashmap. (Also check if element is not repeating by peeking in hashmap)
         Step2 -->  Look for arr2 element in hasmap if not there put it in ans and also hashmap
         Step3 -->  Sort the arrau and retuen the ans

TC here is (n + m) + nlogn
SC here is (n + m)


Optimized:

Intution for optimized is to compare each and evey elemnt of the arr1 and arr2 and put the smaller one
in ans and move the pointer of coresponding array. This way we will need not sort it at the end. Also
everytime we add to ans we check if the last added element is equal to the available element in arrays
if yes we move pointer.

 TC here is (n + m)
 SC is (1)
