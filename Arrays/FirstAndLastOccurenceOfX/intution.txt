Brute Force :

Intution here is to traverse the array and store the 
first and last occurence in variables, keep a flag 
and if element found for first time make it true and store
it in firstOccurence and when flag is true and you again found
the element equal to X add in second variable

TC here is O(n)
SC is O(1)

Optimized:

As the array is sorted we can apply binary search and if element found
run  2 loops, one to left and one two right and if the new element is also eaual to
x update the varaible and when not break


TC = O(n)
SC = O(1)
